# **Chapter 1: Introduction to Azure DevOps**

## **1.1 Defining Azure DevOps**

**Azure DevOps** is a comprehensive Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform from Microsoft that provides an integrated set of tools to support the entire **application lifecycle management (ALM)**. It enables teams to plan, develop, test, deliver, and monitor software in a single, cohesive environment.

### **Core Capabilities**
Azure DevOps consolidates several critical development and operations functions into one portal:
*   **Version Control:** Supports Git and Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) for source code management.
*   **Agile Project Management:** Offers tools for work item tracking, sprint planning, and backlog management using Scrum and Agile methodologies.
*   **Reporting:** Provides built-in dashboards and reporting tools for project analytics and team productivity.
*   **CI/CD Pipelines:** Enables automated builds, tests, and deployments through **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)**.
*   **Test Management:** Facilitates manual and automated testing processes.
*   **Collaboration:** Supports team collaboration through features like pull requests and code reviews.

## **1.2 The Integrated Application Lifecycle**

A key differentiator of Azure DevOps is its ability to manage the **end-to-end project lifecycle**â€”from initial requirement gathering to final deployment into production. This integration eliminates the need to juggle disparate tools, streamlining the entire software development process.

> **Key Term:** **Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)** is the continuous process of managing the life of an application from its initial planning through to its retirement, encompassing requirements, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

## **1.3 Portal Overview and Key Components**

The Azure DevOps portal is organized into several main sections, each dedicated to a specific part of the development lifecycle.

### **A. Boards**
This section is dedicated to **Agile project management**.
*   Used to create and manage **user stories**, **bugs**, and **tasks**.
*   Provides tools for **backlog refinement** and **sprint planning**.
*   Offers interactive dashboards (e.g., Sprint Boards, Taskboards) for teams to visualize work and track progress.

### **B. Repos**
This section provides **version control** repositories.
*   Hosts Git repositories for source code.
*   Supports standard Git workflows: **commits**, **branches**, **pull requests**, and **code reviews**.
*   Serves as a centralized, secure location for team collaboration on code.

### **C. Pipelines**
This is the core component for **automation** and **DevOps** practices.
*   **Build Pipelines:** Automate the process of compiling code, running tests, and creating build artifacts (CI).
*   **Release Pipelines:** Automate the deployment of build artifacts to various environments (e.g., staging, production) (CD).
*   Enables practices like continuous integration, delivery, and deployment to accelerate release cycles and improve quality.

### **D. Other Components**
*   **Test Plans:** A tool for manual and exploratory testing.
*   **Artifacts:** A package management system for sharing Maven, npm, NuGet, and other packages across teams.

## **1.4 Course Structure and Learning Path**

*   Focus on automation and continuous delivery.
*   Topics include: Building CI/CD pipelines, release management, deployment strategies, and integrating Docker containerization.
*   Focus on Agile planning and work tracking.
*   Topics include: Utilizing **Boards**, managing backlogs, sprint planning, and understanding Agile terminology (e.g., user stories, epics).

## **1.5 Prerequisites for Success**

To get the most out of this material, a foundational knowledge in two areas is recommended:
1.  **Git Version Control:** Understanding of basic commands (commit, push, pull, branch) and workflows (pull requests).
2.  **Agile Principles:** Familiarity with core Agile and Scrum concepts such as **sprints**, **backlogs**, **user stories**, and **daily stand-ups**.

## **Key Concepts**

| Concept | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Azure DevOps** | A Microsoft SaaS platform that provides integrated tools for the entire application lifecycle. |
| **Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)** | The end-to-end process of managing an application from conception to retirement. |
| **Boards** | The Azure DevOps module for Agile project management, work tracking, and sprint planning. |
| **Repos** | The Azure DevOps module for Git-based version control and code collaboration. |
| **Pipelines** | The Azure DevOps module for automating builds (CI), tests, and deployments (CD). |
| **Continuous Integration (CI)** | The practice of automatically building and testing code every time a team member commits changes. |
| **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)** | The practice of automatically deploying code changes to various environments after they pass CI tests. |
