# **Chapter 3: Deployment Fundamentals**

## **3.1 The Goal of Deployment**

The primary objective of deployment is to take application code developed on a local machine and make it accessible to end-users over the internet. This process involves moving code from a local development environment to a **server** that can handle requests and deliver responses via protocols like HTTP/HTTPS.

## **3.2 Core Components of Deployment**

### **1. Application/Web Server**
An **application server** (or web server) is a software framework designed to host and run applications. It listens for incoming network requests (typically on a specific port) and returns the appropriate response.

*   **Examples:** Apache Tomcat, Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, Microsoft IIS.
*   **Function:** It executes the application code and serves the resulting web pages, APIs, or services to clients (e.g., web browsers).

### **2. Host Server**
A **host server** is the physical or virtual machine (computer) on which the application server software is installed and runs.

*   **Key Differentiator:** The application server is the *software*; the host server is the underlying *hardware* (or virtualized hardware) that provides computing resources (CPU, RAM, storage).
*   **Cloud Hosting:** Instead of a physical machine in an office, host servers are often virtual machines provisioned from cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

### **3. IP Address and Ports**
Every host server on a network has a unique **IP address** (e.g., `119.45.28.102`). The application server software running on it listens for requests on a specific **port** (e.g., Tomcat often uses port `8080`).

*   To access an application, you direct your browser to the combination of the host server's IP address and the application server's port: `http://<IP_Address>:<Port>`.

### **4. Domain Names**
A **domain name** (e.g., `mywebsite.com`) is a human-readable alias mapped to a server's IP address. This mapping is managed by the Domain Name System (DNS). Users type the domain name into their browser, and DNS resolves it to the correct IP address, making applications easier to access.

## **3.3 The Deployment Process**

Deployment is not simply copying source code files. For most modern applications, the process involves a **build** step.

1.  **Build the Code:** The source code is compiled and packaged into a deployable unit called an **artifact**.
    *   **Java/Maven:** The command `mvn clean install` compiles code, runs tests, and packages the application into a `.war` (Web Application Resource) or `.jar` file.
    *   **Angular/Node.js:** The command `ng build` compiles the application into a `/dist` (distribution) folder containing static files (HTML, CSS, JS).
2.  **Transfer the Artifact:** The generated artifact (e.g., the `.war` file or `/dist` contents) is placed into a specific directory within the application server (e.g., the `webapps` directory in Apache Tomcat).
3.  **Server Execution:** The application server automatically detects, unpacks (if necessary), and runs the artifact, making the application live and accessible.

> **Key Term:** An **artifact** is a deployable package generated by a build process. It contains all the compiled code, dependencies, and resources needed to run the application.

## **3.4 Summary of the Flow**

1.  **Developer writes code** on a local machine.
2.  Code is **built** into an **artifact**.
3.  Artifact is deployed to an **application server** (e.g., Tomcat).
4.  The application server runs on a **host server** with a public IP address.
5.  A **domain name** is pointed to the host server's IP address via DNS.
6.  An **end-user** requests the domain name, which routes to the application server and returns the application.

This foundational understanding of how code moves from a local IDE to a production server is critical for grasping the value of automation tools like **Azure Pipelines**, which automate these manual steps.

### **Key Concepts**

| Concept | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Deployment** | The process of moving built application code to a server where it can be executed and accessed by users. |
| **Application Server** | Software that provides an environment to run applications and serve them over a network (e.g., Tomcat). |
| **Host Server** | The physical or virtual machine that provides the computing resources for the application server to run. |
| **Artifact** | A packaged, deployable unit (e.g., `.war` file, `/dist` folder) generated by a build process. |
| **Domain Name** | A human-readable web address (e.g., `example.com`) that is mapped to a server's IP address via DNS. |
| **Build** | The process of compiling source code and its dependencies into an executable or deployable format. |
