# **Chapter 6: The Target CI/CD Pipeline Architecture**

## **6.1 Objective**

This chapter outlines the end-to-end **CI/CD pipeline** we will construct in the subsequent practical sections. The goal is to create a fully automated workflow that transitions code from a developer's commit to a production deployment, incorporating automated testing at every stage.

## **6.2 Pipeline Overview**

The pipeline we will build demonstrates a mature DevOps practice, automating the entire application lifecycle from code integration to production release. The process is triggered by a single event: a **code push to a GitHub repository**.

## **6.3 Stage 1: Continuous Integration (CI) - Build and Package**

1.  **Trigger:** A developer pushes new code to the designated GitHub repository.
2.  **Action:** **Azure Pipelines** automatically detects the push event.
3.  **Process:**
    *   The pipeline **clones** the repository to fetch the latest code.
    *   It executes the build command (e.g., `mvn clean install` for a Java project).
    *   It runs all associated **unit tests** to validate the new code.
4.  **Output:** If the build and tests pass, the pipeline generates a deployable **artifact** (e.g., a `.war` file for a Java web application).

> **Key Term:** An **artifact** is the packaged, versioned output of a build process, ready for deployment.

## **6.4 Stage 2: Continuous Delivery (CD) - Deploy to Staging**

1.  **Trigger:** The successful creation of a new artifact from the CI stage.
2.  **Action:** The pipeline automatically picks up the artifact.
3.  **Process:** The artifact is deployed to a **staging environment**. This environment is a near-identical copy of the production environment, used for final validation.
4.  **Purpose:** This provides a stable, updated version of the application for testing purposes.

## **6.5 Stage 3: Automated Regression Testing**

1.  **Trigger:** A successful deployment to the staging environment.
2.  **Action:** The pipeline automatically triggers a suite of **Selenium automation tests**.
3.  **Process:** The Selenium tests execute against the newly deployed application in the staging environment, performing end-to-end **regression testing** to ensure no existing functionality is broken.
4.  **Gatekeeper:** This stage acts as a quality gate. The pipeline will only proceed if all automated tests pass.

## **6.6 Stage 4: Deployment to Production**

1.  **Trigger:** Successful passage of all automated regression tests in the staging environment.
2.  **Action:** The pipeline **promotes** the validated artifact.
3.  **Process:** The same artifact that was tested in staging is deployed to the **production environment**.
4.  **Result:** The application is now **live** and accessible to end-users via a web browser.

## **6.7 Key Benefits of This Architecture**

*   **Full Automation:** Eliminates manual, error-prone steps for building, testing, and deploying.
*   **Consistency:** The same artifact is promoted through all environments, ensuring what was tested is exactly what is deployed.
*   **Quality Assurance:** Automated testing at multiple stages provides confidence in the stability of each release.
*   **Speed:** Dramatically reduces the time between writing code and delivering value to users.

This pipeline represents a robust, enterprise-grade DevOps practice. The following chapters will provide a step-by-step guide to implementing this architecture using **Azure Pipelines**.

### **Key Concepts**

| Concept | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | An automated workflow that defines the steps for integrating, testing, and deploying code. |
| **Staging Environment** | A pre-production environment used for final testing before a release goes live. |
| **Regression Testing** | Testing that ensures new code changes do not adversely affect existing functionality. |
| **Promotion** | The process of moving a validated artifact from one environment (e.g., staging) to another (e.g., production). |
| **Quality Gate** | An automated check (e.g., test results) that must be passed before the pipeline can proceed to the next stage. |
